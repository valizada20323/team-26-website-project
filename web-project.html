              <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
              <p>
                As emphasized on the main page, this website was created as homework and aims to provide the best experience and to be informative about us. 
                If you want to get to know us and see our web development skills, just visit here.

              <h2>Team Contributions</h2>
              <p>
                The website has a lot of features, and each member of the team has a different role in the implementation of these features.
                Gurban Gurbanov was responsible for writing the overall context of the website and all the HTML code. The basic CSS and design, the basic look, 
                were designed by Ali Jafarzada. If you've explored it, you'll have noticed that the header text redirects to the lower parts of the site, 
                and the Instagram and YouTube logos redirect you to your social media accounts. These features were built using advanced CSS, and Vaqif Alizada,
                a former CSS practitioner on the team, was responsible for researching and integrating them into the site. 
                Finally, JavaScript codes were researched and added to the site by Nurlan Karibov.
                Nurlan has enabled us to create a greeting when you enter the website using Javascript.
                He added an "up" button so you can go to the top of the website with one click and more features.

              <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
              <p>
                There were some difficulties in the process of building the website. 
                There were several design changes and therefore the code was fundamentally re-typed. 
                After some problems with using Github, we turned to consultants.
                 Eventually, we were able to write code on multiple computers at the same time, but it was a confusing process. 
                 So we decided to continue writing the actual code and submitting commits on one computer.
                  It was not easy for us to learn deeply about JavaScript in a short period of time and with that to add innovations to the website and to prepare the Code Artist section.
