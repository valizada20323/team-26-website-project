      <p>
        The Hour of Code event was our interactive assignment before this website. 
        The event was an engaging and educational experience for the participating students. 
        The session started with a brief introduction of our university and an explanation of the aims and objectives of the event.
        We guided the students to get started by sharing the link to the coding event. 
        Although most of the participants were new to such an event and had little to no previous coding experience, they were eager to explore and learn. 
        As they dived into the activity, their initial hesitation turned into curiosity and enthusiasm.
        The coding session lasted about 40 minutes, during which time the students faced and overcame various challenges. 
        For many, the primary challenge was navigating the coding tasks as they were not familiar with block-based coding platforms. 
        Some needed help understanding how to minimize the number of blocks used to efficiently complete a level.
        Despite these obstacles, the students remained focused and with some guidance, they progressed steadily. 
        Impressively, several students exceeded expectations, reaching advanced levels in a short period of time and completing tasks with little or no assistance.
        To ensure everyone had a smooth experience, we were prepared for potential technical issues.
        When a few students struggled to access the website or encountered device issues, we shared our own devices with them.
        While there were minor interruptions, such as a few participants having to leave early, everyone who stayed successfully completed the event and were awarded their certificates.
        The event ended in a celebratory mood. Each student received a certificate of achievement. 
        The participants were thrilled to see their efforts recognized and this moment was the highlight of the event. 
        To commemorate the event, we gathered the students together for a group photo, but a few who had to leave earlier were unable to attend.
        Overall, the Hour of Code event was successful and fun. It introduced students to the basics of coding in an interactive and supportive environment, 
        sparked their interest in technology and gave them a sense of accomplishment. The event not only showcased the potential of the students, 
        but also emphasized the importance of providing engaging learning opportunities in a structured and positive environment.
